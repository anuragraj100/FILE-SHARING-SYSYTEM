I've created a modern file sharing system with the following features:

Drag-and-drop file upload interface
File list with metadata (name, size, upload date)
File actions:
Download files
Generate shareable links
Delete files
Real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions
Toast notifications for user feedback
Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
Secure file storage using Supabase Storage
Before you can use the system, you'll need to:

Click the "Connect to Supabase" button in the top right to set up your Supabase project
Create a storage bucket named "files" in your Supabase dashboard
Set up the appropriate storage policies in Supabase
The system is now ready to use! You can:

Drag and drop files or click to select them
View all uploaded files with their details
Download files directly
Generate shareable links that expire after 1 hour
Delete files you no longer need
The UI is clean and professional, with smooth animations and clear feedback for all actions. The system is production-ready and includes error handling, loading states, and proper security measures.# FILE-SHARING-SYSYTEM
